## Hello and welcome to my Github page

- I'm currently working as a Software Engineer on the Data Platform team at Coupa Software
- I love to code in Python as I find it readable and enjoy the many libraries

Check out my [Website](https://enzoarata.github.io/) to see my full portfolio and learn more about me

<p>I have several private repositories that contain valuable code, which I view as potential business ventures. While I would love to share some of this code, I choose to keep these repositories private to protect their value. If you are interested in taking a look pleace contact me regarding why.</p>

For those that are curious, here is one of those business ventures. [NFTSuite](https://nftsuite.net/)
